Ever wondered what <mark>\^M</mark> is doing at the end of each line in your code when running `git diff`?
This has most likely something to do with that the file has been edited in a Windows system.

```
public class Hello {^M
    public static void main(String[] args) {^M
      System.out.println("Hello World!");^M
    }^M
}^M
```

Windows, or actually DOS is using *CRLF* (Carriage return + Line feed) as their line endings while Unix only uses *LF*
(Line feed) their line endings.

**Why bother about the \^M? My code works anyway.**

Yes, most likely it does. Though this often cause text files that have been transferred between systems of different
types to be displayed incorrectly. For example, files first created in a Unix system may appear as just a single line
of text in Windows system. When creating a new file on a Windows system and then reading them on a Unix system
the extra CR may be displayed as ^M or <cr> at the end of each line or as a second line break.


## Solution

Use the `dos2unix` command.

This will convert the a.txt to use LF instead of CRLF.

```sh
$ dos2unix a.txt
```

This will run `dos2unix` all files in the current directory.

```sh
$ find . -type f -exec dos2unix {} \;
```

For more information about dos2unix options, please see the dos2unix man page.

```sh
$ man dos2unix
```
