## How Print Friendly & PDF Works
The Print Friendly & PDF button automatically creates printer friendly and PDF versions of your pages without the hassle
of having to create a print CSS file. No coding, hacking or programming required. Simply install the Print Friendly &
PDF plugin, activate, and choose settings for full customization. It also gives your user the ability to remove images
and paragraphs of text, so they really only have to print exactly what they want.
